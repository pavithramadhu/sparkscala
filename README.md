Spark is an unified execution engine.It is easy with scala,an object oriented language which supports many features of functional programming like Lazy Evaluation ,pattern matching and so on.
Like Java,Scala source code is compiled to java bytecode,and the resulting executable code runs on JVM(Java Virtual Machine).
In Scala everything is considered as objects.Eg: Methods in Scala are considered as objects.Scala is a statically typed and dynamically inferred language.


Advantages of Spark:

Spark core supports Java 8,Scala,Phyton and R.
It's as fast 10 to 100 times when compared to mapreduce as it uses in-memory processing.
It uses single platform to handle variety of data.Spark is the replacement for map reduce.
